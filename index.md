Welcome to HOWTOs!
==================

As a developer I often find solutions to problems that I probably will have to solve again 
later. READMEs does the job in some cases, but are cumbersome to maintain and not easily 
search or browsed across projects. So I decided to go for GitHub Pages and Jekyll, which 
combines both worlds nicely. You can read more about [howto make a tutorial here](index.html).
